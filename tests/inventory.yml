# Pulp Automation Invetory File
# =============================
#
# About
# -----
# Pulp automation is a suite of test cases that examine REST API functionality of Pulp.
# A bunch of test cases that verify E2E scenarios with both real and mocked Pulp consumers
# is included. This file provides pulp automation with information necessary to run the
# test cases.
#
# The Pulp Role
# -------------
# describes REST API endpoint the test cases should use:
# - auth: [username, password] for the https REST client
# - url:  the protocol&hots part of the pulp URL
# - hostname: FQDN of the machine running pulp service
#
# The Qpid Role
# -------------
# describes the RMI Broker endbpoint of Pulp for mocked consumer to attach to
# - url: the amqp url of the broker
#
# The Repos Role
# lists various repositories to be used during testing. Test cases apply filter
# criteria on the list to select best repos for testing based on repo attributes:
# - id: mandatory ID field to use in Pulp when referring to the repo
# - type: (importer) type ID to distinguish various repo kinds
# - feed: data source of the repo; the URL
# - display_name: to show in Pulp
# - tags: a list of custom repo "descriptors"
#
# The Consumers Role

# lists consumers to run real Pulp Consumer Client suite on
# Test cases apply filter criteria on the list to select best consumers
# for testing based on consumer attributes:
# - id: mandatory ID field to use in Pulp when referring to the repo
# - hostname: for automation commands execution over ssh
# - ssh_key: for automation commands execution over ssh; root access
# - os
#   - name: of the operating system
#   - version: of the operating system
# - repos: a list of repo pointers or repos to bind the consumer to
# - tags: a list of custom consumer "descriptors"
